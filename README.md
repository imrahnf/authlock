# AuthLock
AuthLock is an **open source authentication microservice** that provides:
- secure user registration
- password-based login
- OAuth login
- refresh token management
- basic session logs
- clean API documentation
- a demo app showing real integration

This service is designed to showcase **backend engineering**, **security practices**, **cloud deployment**, and a **polished developer experience**.
It is explicitly **NOT production-grade**, but it demonstrates the architecture of a real auth provider like Auth0/Clerk/Supabase Auth.
